Added quick select panel.

Removed adjustable/movable menus (due to time constraint), minimization still possible.

Moved menus to the right. Most people read/view from left to right. Thus, the components on the left comes first and is viewed as more important. In this case, the canvas.

Removed unpopular color models such as L-A-B, C-M-Y-K in favor of R-G-B for simplicity.

Altered some icons for clarity.
